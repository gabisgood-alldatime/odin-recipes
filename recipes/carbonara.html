<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This rich pasta toss is great for everyday dinners or special occasions. I can come home from work and throw this dish together in a half hour.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups rigatoni pasta</li>
        <li>6 slices bacon, diced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cut into cubes</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup freshly shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh green peas</li>
        <li>¼ cup diced cooked ham</li>
    </ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 13 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon, leaving drippings in pan; set bacon aside.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir garlic in the remaining bacon grease over medium heat. Add milk, cream cheese, and butter to skillet; stir until smooth. Stir Parmesan cheese, peas, ham, and bacon into cream cheese mixture; cook until peas are heated through, about 5 minutes more. Mix pasta into sauce to serve.</li>
